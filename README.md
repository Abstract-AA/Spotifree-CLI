## Overview

Spotifree is a bash script that transforms your terminal into a music streaming platform without ads or distractions. Designed for keyboard-centric users who want instant music without leaving their workflow. It can perform a non specific search for songs, so the song name can have typos and parts of the lyrics are also acceptable as inputs. 

For a smooth streaming experience, the latest verion of yt-dlp is usually required.

## Features

- **Download Audio files** - Any song can be downloaded
- **Playlists** - Create playlists by writing multiple song names separated by commas or by using the "á¹•" flag when file browsing
- **Local Audio File Support** - A file browser is included, and any local audio files can also be played
- **Repeat Mode** - Replay tracks without re-searching (cached playback)
- **Playback Controls** - Completely integrated MPV controls (pause/seek/volume/loop)
- **Lightweight** - Less than 1 mb, no GUI overhead or resource-heavy apps
- **Simple Setup** - Just bash + 2 dependencies

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

First, to install the dependencies run the following in a system with Bash:

```bash
sudo apt install yt-dlp mpv                 # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install yt-dlp mpv                 # Fedora and its derivatives
sudo apk update && sudo apk add mpv yt-dlp  # Alpine Linux
sudo pacman -S mpv && sudo pacman -S yt-dlp #Arch linux and its derivatives
brew install yt-dlp mpv                     # macOS
```
Then, move on to downloading the main file.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abstract-AA/Spotifree-CLI/refs/heads/main/spotifree
     
chmod +x spotifree

./spotifree

```

Note: Some distributions have older versions of yt-dlp, and this can cause issues when running the app. Therefore, in this case its ideal to download the latest version of yt-dlp in a python enviroment, and then run the script:

```bash
# ====== INSTALL LATEST yt-dlp ON ARCH / FEDORA / DEBIAN/UBUNTU ======

# === 0. PREREQUISITES ===
# Make sure Python and pip are installed

sudo pacman -S python python-pip # Arch

sudo apt install python3 python3-pip # Debian/Ubuntu

sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip # Fedora

# === 1st METHOD: pipx (Recommended) ===

sudo pacman -S pipx # Arch

sudo apt install pipx # Debian/Ubuntu

sudo dnf install pipx # Fedora

pipx install yt-dlp  # Install yt-dlp via pipx

pipx upgrade yt-dlp # (To upgrade later)

# ====== 2nd METHOD: virtualenv (Manual isolation) ======

pip install --user virtualenv # Install virtualenv if needed

python3 -m venv yt-dlp-env
source yt-dlp-env/bin/activate  # Create and activate virtual environment

pip install yt-dlp # Install yt-dlp inside the venv

deactivate # Deactivate environment when done

```

## Future plans

- Add a progress bar that updates as the song plays

- Add audio bars

- Add general interface improvements
